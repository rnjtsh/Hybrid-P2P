### Please ensure that your program is robust and doesn't crash. Both the server and the client programs must stay inside the provided "root" directory at all times. All file path must be relative to this "root"

### How we'll call the client
./executable client_alias client_ip client_port server_ip server_port downloading_port client_root

eg. ./client "Bob's Computer" 127.0.0.9 8756 127.0.0.2 12345 14000 ~/Desktop

### How we'll call the server
./executable server_ip server_port main_repofile client_list_file server_root

eg. ./server 127.0.0.2 12345 Main_Repository_File.txt Client_Info_File.txt ~/Raja/CRS
